  * [Disclosure Policy](#disclosure-policy)
  * [Comments on this Policy](#comments-on-this-policy)

## Reporting a Bug

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at anthony@astrobase.cloud.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the maintaining team will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party software to the person or team maintaining
that software.

## Disclosure Policy

When the team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to DockerHub and other artifact registries.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
